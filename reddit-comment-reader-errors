How hidden was it exactly? They all admitted to it in the end. And you saw Festina literally getting caught with all of it in the car. One Premier League player has even been banned for taking a performance enhancing drug, and his sentence was reduced because it was against some virus.

&gt; The Panama Papers was a massive conspiracy kept secret for years.

Yes, even an army of well-educated people couldn't keep their tax avoidance a secret from a bunch of newspapers. But all footballers are doing it for eternity.

&gt; Players and staff have something to lose if they admit their part.

While doing it. Maybe. Afterwards, not so much. Something to gain in a financial sense, but no one is taking the money. Incredible considering how many former footballers have gone bankrupt, huh?

&gt; They have no proof and would make huge enemies by trying to talk about it.

Aha, so they engage in doping use throughout their career with no proof. In my country a bloke sawed a women in pieces in his submarine, virtually chained it to the ocean floor and police found it all within months. But no player has any proof of using doping in a fifteen year football career. Actually, I believe that to be true for the vast majority, because they haven't been using doping.

As for the "making huge enemies claim. Oh no. Anyways.

&gt; There's a good chance they don't even know what drugs and supplements the clubs give them.

Interesting. Weird how such a thing is (basically) never the case in any other sport. If all you're doing is crush a bit of pills in their spaghetti, you might as well not risk your entire existence on it. Just hire a physical trainer with one more PhD than the last one.

My run took 100 hours, although it should have been around 80.  At the 80 hour mark I did not know how close to finishing I was, and the spaghetti had gotten so out of control, I chose that moment to rip/replace/rebuld the entire base, that took some time.

Excess water, yah, that was just annoying.  Basically I dumped all excess water back into the feeder lines of the refinery, with a pump that only added additional water when the loop got low.  

Regarding bugs (and ammo), I never got enough production of anything beyond blue bullets.  But for defense, blue bullets can carry you through the entire game, assuming you throw enough of them at the enemy. The higher tiers beyond blue are nice, but unnecessary, and use materials you'd rather save for something else.  Blue bullets were of no use against endgame worms though, so for offensive bug clearing, I of course went with rockets.

I was hoping that liquid metals would somehow be an answer to production balance.  Like, the ability to use them as a copper slush storage while desperately behind on Nickle, but it didn't work out, the storage density of liquid metal was just too low.

In the end, to satisfy pure metal requirements, an entirely separate refining base was built for production of sulfuric acid, so I could fully leverage the advanced ore washing recipes.  It wasn't until the very end that I realized the answer was to build a smart advanced ore washing facility - that based on how low I was on pure chromium, nickle, lead, or ...gold thingy..., loaded crushed iron, copper, tin, or gold.  Because the ore washers only input one item at a time, it can be done trivially without jamming.  Once I did that, and pumped the results back into my main factory, it balanced itself out.
